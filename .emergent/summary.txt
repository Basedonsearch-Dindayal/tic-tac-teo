The trajectory details the AI engineer's process of building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game for Android using Expo. The user's initial request was to create a simple tic toc toe game for android app, later refined to simple and fast. The AI engineer thoroughly reviewed the existing project structure, including , , and . A detailed plan was formulated, focusing on a frontend-only implementation for core game logic, UI design, and mobile optimizations.

The engineer successfully implemented the game in , incorporating a 3x3 grid, player turn tracking, winner detection, and a reset function. Initial UI screenshots confirmed the design and layout. A subsequent fix addressed accessibility and testability issues by ensuring cells were properly interactive. Functional tests verified correct game interaction, player switching, and reset functionality. After backend testing (which confirmed the existing backend template was functional, though not modified for this feature), the engineer updated  and restarted the frontend. The final action was to ask the user about proceeding with frontend testing, adhering to the established protocol.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a simple and fast Tic-Tac-Toe game for an Android mobile application, built using Expo. The game should be a basic two-player experience.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
A fully functional, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game has been implemented entirely on the frontend. It features:
*   A 3x3 game board grid.
*   Visual display of X and O marks for player moves.
*   Tracking of the current player's turn (X or O).
*   Logic for detecting a win condition (three in a row, column, or diagonal).
*   A New Game button to reset the board and start a new game.
*   A clean, mobile-friendly user interface with appropriate touch targets.
*   Accessibility enhancements for clickable cells.

<current_work>
Currently, a simple and fast two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game has been fully implemented on the frontend of the Expo application. The game logic, UI, and state management are contained within .

The implemented game features:
-   A responsive 3x3 grid using  components for clickable cells.
-   Visual representation of 'X' and 'O' for player moves.
-   Dynamic display of the  or .
-   Logic to detect winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and declare a winner or a draw.
-   A  button to reset the board and restart gameplay.
-   The UI adheres to mobile-first design principles with appropriate padding, margins, and touch target sizes.
-   Accessibility has been considered, with interactive elements properly configured for testing.

Following implementation, automated frontend interaction tests were conducted, confirming that:
1.  Game interactions (placing X/O) work as expected.
2.  Player turns switch correctly.
3.  The New Game reset functionality is successful.
4.  The overall design is mobile-friendly.

The backend service () was also briefly tested and confirmed to be operational, although no modifications were made for this specific feature. The  file has been updated to reflect the successful completion of these tasks. The immediate next step is awaiting user confirmation for full frontend testing.
